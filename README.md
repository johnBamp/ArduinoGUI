# ArduinoGUI
This is a widget based GUI libary for the ILI9341 tft w/ capacitive touchsccreen. 
I designed this to mimmick GUI libaries like tkinter from python and qt5. 
Buttonss, labels, and scrollable labels for large texts that clip off the screen are all supported.
This is a work in progress, so more widgets will be added in the future.
If you'd like to add to this, feel free.

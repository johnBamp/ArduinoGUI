# ArduinoGUI for ILI9341 TFT with Capacitive Touchscreen
ArduinoGUI is a widget-based GUI library tailored for the ILI9341 TFT equipped with a capacitive touchscreen. Inspired by renowned GUI libraries like Python's tkinter and Qt5, this library offers a robust platform to build interactive GUI applications for Arduino environments.
Features:
-Widget-Based Design: Simplifies the creation of UI components such as buttons, labels, and more.
-Scrollable Labels: Perfect for long texts that might clip off the screen.
-Rich Widget Collection: From basic buttons to intricate components, ArduinoGUI is continually evolving. As this project is in active development, expect the addition of more widgets in the future.
=Interactive Applications: The library is not just limited to static widgets. Quality of life features, like an integrated keyboard, have been added to facilitate the creation of interactive applications.
